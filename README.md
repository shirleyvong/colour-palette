# ðŸŽ¨ Colour Palette Generator
This project is a web application for users to generate colour palettes by uploading a photo. Users can save palettes to their individual collection and also view palettes by other users. 

Colour palettes are generated by partitioning an image's pixels using the median cut colour quantization algorithm. The average RGB values for each partition correspond to a colour on the palette.

When generating a palette, the image is reduced to under 100x100 pixels and 5 colours are generated to improve speed at cost of colour accuracy. These values can be changed in the back-end code.

## Build Instructions
1. Build Docker images using:

	```
	docker-compose build && docker-compose up
	```

	**Initial build takes a couple minutes (around 6 for me)**. Wait until the terminal prints:
	
	```
	Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
	```

2. Open the application on your browser at  `localhost`
