# ðŸŽ¨ Colour Palette Generator
This project is a web application for users to generate colour palettes by uploading a photo. Users can save palettes to their individual collection and also view palettes by other users.

Colour palettes are generated by partitioning an image's pixels using the median cut colour quantization algorithm. The average RGB values for each partition correspond to a colour on the palette.

## Technologies
Programming languages:
- **Javascript**: React front-end 
- **Rust**: Colour quantization algorithm
- **Python**: Flask back-end

Communication methods:
- **REST API**: Javascript and Python communicate through HTTP
- **FFI**: Python calls Rust code through [rust-cpython](https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython) to execute the quantization algorithm

## Build Instructions
1. Build Docker images using:
	```
	docker-compose build && docker-compose up
	```
	**Initial build takes a couple minutes (around 6 for me)**. Wait until the terminal prints:
	```
	Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
	```  
2. Open the application on your browser at  `localhost`
